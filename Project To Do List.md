- [ ] Conduct network stress testing for communication stability

## 🔵 Dynamic Graph Environment Development
- [ ] **Objective:** Create a graph-based environment for flood risk–aware routing.
- [ ] Design a graph model representing Marikina City’s road network
- [ ] Integrate GIS shapefiles and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data
- [ ] Incorporate flood hazard maps and hydrological model outputs
- [ ] Enable real-time edge weight updates using incoming geospatial and sensor data
- [ ] Implement a hazard scoring system per edge

## 🔵 Baseline Environment Development (Non-Multi-Agent)
- [ ] **Objective:** Create a single-agent control environment for baseline evaluation.
- [ ] Implement a centralized routing and risk assessment module
- [ ] Conduct performance tests (Computation time, Route accuracy, System scalability)

## 🔵 Risk-Aware A* Search Algorithm
- [ ] **Objective:** Optimize routing using a customized A\* search algorithm.
- [ ] Implement the A* algorithm integrating flood risk

## 🔵 Simulation of MAS-FRO
- [ ] **Objective:** Validate system performance in dynamic flood scenarios.
- [ ] Configure multiple agent instances
